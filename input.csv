"My friend, I have a 9 year old low functioning autistic daughter. As you can tell from the gif, people with special needs lack fine motor skills that Neuro typical people like you and I take for granted. Special needs people often lack verbal communication that also you and I take for granted. The girl in the gif made a very good bball shot and used descent form! This doesn't just happen on a whim for a special needs person. She had to have practiced a ton while lacking said fine motor skills and communication. 
  
  People with Special needs never have an opportunity to be in a situation like this. To have people cheering for them ,unless it's a specific special needs event. Believe it or not, alot of special needs people often stay behind closed doors because they get made fun of, get ignored; or like my daughter, look "" normal"" but when has a meltdown, people assume she's a spoiled brat looking for attention. 
  
  Please please pander to the special needs community. Many of them will never have a significant other, will never be able to drive a car, go out and see a movie, have a job or even have a best friend. Many people stare at them, make jokes, or get completely ignored.

"The ""Left"" is not a single entity the way you're talking about it. The US is hundreds of millions of people, and yet you speak of this Left as if millions of people were having a single reaction in unison. Democrats (if that's what you mean by the Left) weren't expecting Obama to destroy racism once-and-for-all. They considered it a good sign he got elected, but only the biggest idiots were naive enough to think having a black president would solve all race issues in 8 years. I knew plenty of black people who thought having a black president wouldn't change anything for black people. I know that's anecdotal, but so is the entire claim I'm replying to.
 
 I know it can make you feel like you're so much more wise than a bunch of people when you pretend they all acted in this very stupid and hypocritical way you have written about, but the changes over eight years in the mindsets of millions of people you don't know are not something you can see. I know it can be fun to pretend the world is less complex than it is, especially when you think it makes you right, but just pointing out it's complicated and you haven't actually witnessed what you're talking about, but really just witnessed way fewer than millions of people's reactions to Obama's presidency and pretended that the way you define them defines how millions of people reacted.
 
 It amazes me how people can sincerely think they can have millions of people they never met to a T."
In 2008 Obama got 69M votes. That's not even 25% of the country. Don't make your ignorance so obvious.

"So lemme get your and 43 other people’s argument here straight?
 
 
 Your argument is that this is fake - or has a 90% probability of being fake at least? (Right? Cause what’s the point of your comment otherwise? - I mean, other than to be a strange nit-picker who just wanted to point out that *while this likely did actually happen*, and the response is appropriate, it’s likely that the person who wrote it was *only quoting* someone else who actually did say it but not expressing it themselves).
 
 
 And that’s because it’s on quora - which you feel is 90% trolls who post completely fabricated things?
 
 
 So the presupposition behind your reasoning is that “because it’s on quora, that means there is a 90% chance it’s never actually happened”?
 
 
 So anything I find on quora, there is a 90% chance that it did not happen?
 
 
 Therefore this most likely has not happened?

Hard work means more than what's in between your fucking legs. Try harder. Be better. Maybe even try to have an open mind and adjust your opinions based off evidence and experience? Not once did I state that women are better than men. Yet you all keep telling me that men are better than women. We're equals. Crazy idea, I know. And if you didn't come out of a pussy you wouldn't be alive right now reading this, but maybe your life is so miserable that you wish you were never born and you resent women so you can blame someone other than yourself.

It's a horrible doctrine, dreamed up by a barbaric megalomaniac who spread a murderous doctrine for his own egotistical benefit.
 
 That's ridiculous. If there were only good Muslims, referring to Islam as something awful would make no sense whatsoever. Therefore it's only reasonable to assume that every good Muslim does work to change Islam itself. If their view of the doctrine results in good, how can you call it a horrible doctrine?
 
 > The issue with Islam is that there is not a single sect, of the 72 known denominations, that condemn Muhammad for even one of his many and well documented atrocities. To the contrary, even the most ""moderate"" of Muslims is forced to push the false narrative of a ""perfect"" prophet, in spite of the fact he was a fucking animal.
 
 When this is true, they are forced by people, not by ""Islam.""
 
 > Further, there is no denomination that openly states that even a word of the Qur'an is less than completely perfect, including the many calls to violence.
 
 Yeah this is because they disagree with how to interpret the Qur'an. This is obviously true considering the number of aforementioned sects.
 
 > So even a ""peaceful"" Muslim is guilty of propagating the inherent violence, intolerance, and archaic jurisprudence of the faith.
 
 In your view, sure. I can't stop you from viewing all of this as truth, these are your beliefs. When I refer to good or peaceful Muslims, I don't use quotes. The fact that you do is telling. I'm aware of such Muslims and know them well, I have serious doubts that you can say the same."

People that get in shape make it a personal decision, not because everyone was constantly reminding them. My sister is overweight and she didn’t start losing weight until my family stopped bitching to her about it. She knew, they didn’t need to keep telling her she’s fat every week.

We are all quite scientifically speaking, not just racially different but actual subspecies compared to Blacks. We bred with other hominids smarter than ourselves, they didn’t.

"I'm not saying what is happening in South Africa is a good thing, you are completely right about Zimbabwe, though I would hesitate to so strickly say it was only whites who are responsible for positive changes in African countries. 
 
 What I'm getting at is that while this is clearly a terrible policy, not just economically but on a human rights in general scale, this isn't a black people vs. White people. In this specific case it is White vs. Black.
 
 The tactics being used there are the very same that are used in almost every country to attack the minority. 
 
 I don't believe the problems with much of Africa is simply because of white settlers, nor am I inclined to believe that the struggles of African nations are because of their race.
 
 Africa will likely always struggle to survive, because they are hyper resource rich (which without strong democratic processes and anti-corruption policies will always lead to corrupt power of it's leaders), have a dramatically changing climate (not talking about climate change, just that the continent specifically is very low on rivers and has intense and variable weather patterns) and are at greater risk for the spread of disease (since they lack the natural contagion of colder temperatures)
 
 
 Plus several studies have proven that higher temperatures lead to less patience and greater displays of aggression. 
 
 I find it unfortunate that you are willing to portray all black people as unable to govern themselves, and whites as some kind of superhero. We all know melanin levels and any other quality are not linked.
 
 
 A minority is facing the threat of being pushed off their land. This is wrong. Being white or black is tertiary to the demagoguery being used to attack another in an absense of logic and reason."

Non of these are ideological reasons they are practical reasons. Taking land off of white people because of their races perceived wrongdoings is ideological. This will not improve south Africa.
People like you make the rest of us white people look bad.
Is this bait or just plain racism?
"I see why the whites would leave SA, but to say this is more than the holocaust is just obscene."
"A woman is considerably more likely to be permanently injured or die in labor than she is to suffer anything physically permanent from an abortion. Especially in the US where we have abysmal maternal care, and barely any followup care for postpartum moms."
"How about you go back in time and tell 12 year old me that at least I was attractive enough to have a car full of high-schoolers slow roll me in a mini-van and shout sexually explicit things while I was just trying to walk to the 7/11. I'm sure 12 year old me was just giving off those vibes that I wanted it. 12 year old me who'd never even kissed a boy and turned bright red whenever I heard curse words. 12 year old me who didn't ask to hit puberty so early and shoot up to 5'8 between 6th and 7th grade and have noticeable breasts. 12 year old me who was staring straight ahead, unblinking, acting like I was ignoring these things but terrified to do anything else but keep walking. 12 year old me with tears in my eyes as they started calling me a bitch and a cunt and eventually threw a half-finished Big Gulp, which exploded at my feet. 
  
  But sure. Cat-calling is totally innocent - I should just be grateful for having received that sort of attention because it means I was attractive."

You sound like a Saudi. Get a grip on yourself. It's reasonable to expect men to behave like civilized human beings even when they find a woman attractive.
"You forgot your /s, I hope."
"There's a difference between ""Hey, you look beautiful!"" and ""Hey, let me grab that ass, baby!"" 
  
  If his comment is anything like the second one, she has every right to be offended. You can easily compliment someone without sounding like horn dog."
It's a piss poor attempt at social dominance or sometime it's a male bonding activity. It's moronic and pisses the fuck out of most women. Non-pathetic males don't do it.
"Wtf, you're trying to explain the purpose of cat-calling to the targets of it?"
"Aww, the microdick red piller thinks wearing certain clothes deserves sexual harassment. üò¢"
"She's a model doing a photo shoot. She is working. Unless you're literally working in the sex industry, it's not expected or deserved. It's also not the end of the world or even among the worst things that happen to people. It just happens. 
  
  And no, wearing certain fashions does not sexually signal wanting someone to yell things at you and then grab their crotch as they approach you."
"I've been a drunk girl on whyte, have lots of girlfriends who have been drunk girls on whyte, none of us have ever been receptive to it."
Fuck you you're an asshole
"I can only wonder what has spoiled your heart to such an extent that you would write off all those people, many who are no longer walking this earth, as ""spoiled teenage girls"".
  
  Hang your fucking head"
No we won't
they want supremacy. all identitarians do.
It's this an alt account or copied reply because there's a word for word identical post on the Scotland sub post about this.
"So it's exactly like your sub, only less racism and bans?"
Relax
You know LeBron is neither white nor a perpetrator of horrible things. And he's pretty rich
You actually believe that? Sad
Sorry forgot this was 4chan
/r/ThatHappened
You must be having a really bad day today
And these whores still complain about inequality. This is infuriating.
Oh yeah I forgot engineering automatically becomes incredibly easy if you're a girl.
You make it easy to spot the butthurt.
This is why we can't have a legitimate political conversation on the internet.
"Open his comment history, fourth or so comment has ""REEEEEE"" in it. 'Nuff said."
You seem like a nice guy
">get a job homo
  
  Way to be the bigger person."
need a hug buddy? lil snowflake trump supporter
Thank you... I was looking for this.
I'm sorry that you lost your incel sub.
Jesus fuck man. I forget how conservative some people are.
Because who gives a shit? Let the woman live her life man.
Or they're confident enough that the thought of them sleeping with others doesn't bother them.
She must be a Trump supporter
"They have the largest cash reserve of any company in the world, I think they're doing just fine. And their marketing is often touted as some of the best in any industry; just because Reddit hates this one advert doesn't mean their entire marketing department (let alone their company as a whole) is ‚Äòretarded'."
"No. They're arrested and convicted more often.
  
  If police stats told the whole story that would mean police never shoot anyone, since they don't track their shootings"
Based on...... the disproportionate rate that they're arrested...
I'm not the dumb asshole here who thinks you can just say someone's dead without some sort of investigation.
"Out of curiosity, how is that retarded?"
Hurhurhur hows that derp rage workin out for ya
"Im not being a baby, nor am i offended by the original post. But it belongs on the sub, yeah it's not as 'offensive' as some of the other things here, but it's still well within the nature of this sub, i dont really see the problem. The typical attitude you have of ""stop being a cry baby"" is one of the main reasons so many guys struggle with depression alone, because if they reach out to someone with that attitude it isnt gonna help. I know it's not the most offensive post, but it's the principle"
maybe look at the sub deeper than this post before you make your assertions?
I'd say the 600 comments here jerking each other off about how unfair to men it is that Google has been accused of doing something in a lawsuit that hasn't been shown to have merit kind of is a good example.
"I mean, everybody is in a rage because of how they are handling classified data, right...? Guys? We are angry about the reckless nature that classified data is being transmitted...? *crickets*"
"You should edit out the crickets, you child.
 
 Hilary, the loser you can't seem to stop talking about, had access to classified information as a result of her experience in office. There was a risk of not handling that information properly, so there was an investigation that proved fruitless.
 
 Kushner had access to classified information as a result of wifey's daddy saying he should, with no prior experience. There seems to be a high risk of him selling that information to pay off debts. Luckily, most Trump fans hate Jews almost as much as they love trumps soft, weak, body, so something is FINALLY being done to take away access that was stupid to allow in the first place."
"That was a sarcastic comment, not serious at all."
"lol cool, every time I encounter a thick headed gun nut i'm not going to do anything because you are the past and the country will move on without you."
You’re ignorant and naive if you think people who support the second amendment are a thing of the past.
Jackass
Haha cmon. It’s a joke highlighting the fact that it was obvious they were wearing the same jersey.
Dumbass
You really get joy out of posting this?
How lonely are you?
Quite. Do you wanna spoon?
"Just like every other person in your life, I'm gonna have to she a pass"
Jackass.
The wage gap isn't real but those other two points are just transphobia please stop
"As a trans person who lurks here because I'm interested in the topic of journalistic integrity and censorship, it's pretty shitty having to wade through intentionally divisive shit like this to find actual, relevant, thoughtful discussion. Someone saying it is one thing... that's just free speech. But people mass upvoting something so blatantly dehumanizing and downvoting any negative response to oblivion speaks volumes of the community here. Everything they say about this sub is true, you know. I can tell I'm not welcome here simply because of who I am, and about half of ya'll could give two shits about journalism, you prefer to take cheap shots at people who are different just for a few buddy points from your internet clan. Ya'll are exactly as filter-bubbly and tribalistic as those you accuse.
 
 To the minority of you guys who are calling out the transphobia, thank you. You give me a tiny bit of hope that there may still be a sliver of humanity over on this side of the internet. Sad that you're getting drowned out."
"Well, enjoy accomplishing nothing because you inherently lack a moral foundation to build off of. But you do you I guess."
"> That said, trans-whatever is a mental illness. Full stop, end of story. There are only two genders
 
 Man. Sometimes I forget how many ignorant people are in this sub. A sub that is supposed to be about people who do a bit more research. 
 
 There is a difference between sex and gender. 
 
 Someone being trans is SEX related. Not gender related. 
 
 As for there being only 2 genders, gender is a social construct and throughout history there have been dozens of cultures with multiple genders. Including the Greeks, who we derive much of our culture from. 
 
 Please explain to me what my gender has to do with the fact that gender roles dictate as a man I'm to wear pants, pay for dates, and not show feelings? 
 
 Gender, and the roles that come with it, are a social construct. 3000 years ago, anyone following a masculine gender would have had to wear dresses."
"Yeah, fuck you!"
"I'll be honest with you. I'm a progressive feminist socialist.
 
 
 But fuck that asshole, they are the worst kind of bourgeoise neo-liberal scum bag."
Only pusillanimous pussies tolerate hypocrisy .
I'm just butthurt so I have something to bitch about.
"Im not being a baby, nor am i offended by the original post. But it belongs on the sub, yeah it's not as 'offensive' as some of the other things here, but it's still well within the nature of this sub, i dont really see the problem.

Then you're just being a baby. Good for you.
"Nope, i read your point, dont worry!"
"And?
 
 You're missing my point."
"Think you might be in the wrong the sub, if it was the other way round, Buzzfeed objectifying women there would be murder"
"> angry incels 
 
 Oh, it's you lot again.
 
 > fake outrage
 
 It's not fake outrage; it's not any sort of outrage. It's just pointing out the double standard. The usual, usually ignored double standard. You could make a case that human society has run on just that for thousands of years, and I'd suspect that you would be right; but today is not thousands of years ago, today is unprecedented.
 
 Either get clued up, or just accept you're part of the problem."
If you don't give a shit about anyone's rights why are you even here other than to quite obviously ask double ended questions? Troll level 0/10
People this ignorant should kill themselves. Is that too much to ask...?
